# LolSynergy

Hello! This project is a work in progress.  
I am using it to refamiliarize myself with C# (and because it's useful!).  
The current goal is to get win/loss stats per champion on your team, but there will be more features!  
I'm starting out with a console application but plan on scaling it up to a full-fledged ASP.NET application.  
More details soon!
